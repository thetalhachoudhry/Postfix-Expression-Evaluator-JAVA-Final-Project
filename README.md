Designed and implemented a stack-based calculator to evaluate postfix expressions using Java. 
Built a custom generic LinkedStack class following a defined StackInterface with core stack operations.
Parsed string tokens to identify operands and operators, and evaluated expressions in real time.
Used exception handling to manage stack underflow and invalid expression cases.
Verified functionality through multiple test cases and ensured modular, object-oriented structure.
